    <h3>How to Cook the Smoky Sweet Root Vegetables</h3>
    <div>
    <p5> The day before, put the butter, sugar, and 500ml water in a deep frying pan. Then you will heat the butter until it is melted.
      You will then bring the liquid to the boil and simmer. After boiling the butter, drop in the parsnips and cook for 6-8 mins until
      they are tender and use thongs to transfer to a roasting tin. Repeat with the carrots then tip them into the roasting tin
      with the parsnips. Leave to cool overnight in a fridge.</p5>
</div>
<br/>
      <p6>When you are ready to eat the vegetables, take the roots out the fridge and lift them out of the syrup. Dispose of the syrup.
        Heat in a frying pan until the vegetables are searing hot. Put the roots cut-side down in the pan and cook for a min on each side
        until they are visibly charred. Sprinkle over the smoked salt, lemon juice and some parsley to serve.</p6>
