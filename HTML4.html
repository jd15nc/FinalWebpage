    <h3>How to Cook Mince Pies</h3>
    <p6>First we place 375g plain flour and 260g softened unsalted butter in a bowl and rub together to a crumb consistency. Next we add 125g
      caster sugar and 1 large beaten egg, and mix together. Once mixxed, tip out onto a lightly floured surface and fold until the pastry
      comes together, be careful not to over mix. Wrap the pastry in cling film and chill for 10 mins. Scoop the large jar of mincemeat into a bowl
      and add 2 segmented satsumas, 1 finely chopped apple and zest of 1 lemon.

      <p7>Next we heat the oven to 220C/200C and set the fan or gas to 7. Once done, roll out the pastry to 3mm thick.
      Using a round cutter , which is about 10cm, cut out 16 bases and place them into muffin trays. Put 1 and a half tbsp mincemeat mixture into each. Brush the edge of each pie with a little beaten egg.
      Next we re-roll out the pastry to cut 7cm lids and press them on top to seal. Once rolled, glaze with the beaten egg, sprinkle with the extra caster sugar, then make a small cut in the tops. Now we can
      bake the mince pies for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool before releasing them from the muffin trays and dusting with a little more icing sugar before serving.
